## ðŸ“š Exercise 1
The aim of this exercise is to implement the algorithm of choice of valued courses seen in the course, this one being based on
dynamic programming.
A course is encoded by an array with three entries: its start date, its end date, and its value. A set of courses
is an array of courses.

### Question 1
Complete the `random_courses` function which generates a set of random courses.

### Question 2
Complete the function `sort_courses` which sorts a set of courses by increasing end date.

### Question 3
